## Overview

**Capstone Project:** Research and Implementation of a Centralized Management and Processing System for Cyber Attack Events   
This project aims to design and implement a centralized **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system for collecting, parsing, detecting, and visualizing cyberattack events using the **ELK Stack**.  
It also integrates detection rules based on the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**, simulates APT attack scenarios, and evaluates detection coverage in a SOC-like environment.
